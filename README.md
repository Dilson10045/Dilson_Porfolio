### **Project Overview**

In this project, I analyzed trends and patterns in given data to generate actionable insights that would contribute to our department's success. The goal was to identify key factors influencing sales and provide recommendations to improve performance.

### **Data Sources**

I worked with multiple databases using Azure Studio, which included customer data, product data, order data, and a main table from Fall 2023. Access to these datasets allowed me to track changes in profit, analyze product sales, and understand business operations from a data-driven perspective. Initially, the project simulated a business environment, but we later assumed the role of employees providing strategic input to management.

### **Data Preparation**

To transform raw data into meaningful insights, I used Python to extract and visualize key relationships, particularly between order data and product data. By applying inner joins, I connected product and customer data tables, enabling a more comprehensive analysis. Since certain attributes, such as country names, appeared multiple times, I grouped the data to consolidate entries and sum profits, making it easier to identify overall trends.

After refining the dataset, I utilized Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, along with tools such as Power BI, to create visual representations of sales performance and product demand.

### **Data Analysis**

My analysis focused on identifying key trends in consumer reach, global sales distribution, purchasing patterns, and overall sales metrics. By examining geographic sales data and high-performing products, I uncovered patterns that could guide strategic decision-making and drive department success.
